## UX Hard Gate (frontend changes only)
Reference docs:

- `/docs/frontend/ux-render-prompts-v1.md`

- [ ] I reviewed the relevant UX guideline sections and implemented all applicable rules.
- [ ] I reviewed and used the relevant generated render(s) as visual implementation reference.
- [ ] Layout uses mandatory page zones in required order.
- [ ] Visual tokens (spacing, radius, colors, elevation, typography) follow guideline contract.
- [ ] Forms use RHF + Zod with validation on blur + submit.
- [ ] Money display and owed/owed semantics follow domain UX rules.
- [ ] Accessibility checks completed (keyboard flow, labels/aria, contrast, chart/table alternatives).
- [ ] I included desktop + mobile screenshots and one interaction state (loading/error/empty).
- [ ] Any deviation from UX guideline is documented below with justification and follow-up issue.
